# Learning and Practice Projects

This repository is a **personal archive of programming practice and experiments** across various languages and technologies.  
The projects are beginner to intermediate level and are created for the purpose of **learning, revising, and skill development**.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a programming language or domain:

- `Java/` – OOP projects and exercises in Java
- `...` – More languages and domains as I learn them

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice core programming concepts
- Solve problems from exams, online sources, or AI-generated prompts
- Build a habit of writing, testing, and organizing code
- Create a base to improve or expand into real-world projects

## 🧠 Reuse and Contribution

These projects are intended for personal growth and education, but you are welcome to:
- Reuse and adapt them
- Suggest improvements
- Use them as learning examples

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **learning-focused repository**, so not all code is production-ready.  
Some projects may be incomplete, experimental, or written with simplicity in mind.
