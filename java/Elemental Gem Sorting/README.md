# ðŸ’Ž Elemental Gem Sorting

This project simulates a sorting system for magical gems, each associated with an element (e.g., Fire, Water, Earth). It uses basic Java classes and arrays to sort gems by type, rarity, and elemental category.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Add and store gems with attributes: name, element, rarity
- Sort gems alphabetically or by rarity
- Display gems grouped by element

## ðŸ§° Concepts Used

- Java classes and objects
- Arrays and sorting
- Switch statements and loops

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This was built as a creative practice of sorting algorithms and class design using a fantasy-themed idea.
