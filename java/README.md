# Java Practice Projects

This folder contains all my **Java-based learning projects**, mainly focused on:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O
- Data structures
- Basic algorithms

## ðŸ“‹ Sources

These projects come from:
- Previous university exams
- AI-generated exercises
- Online tutorials and challenges
- My own practice ideas

## ðŸ§± Project Types

Examples include:
- Sensor data logger and analyzer
- Java file parsing and date formatting
- Small OOP systems using classes, arrays, and ArrayLists

## ðŸš§ Status

Some projects are complete, others are partial or experimental.  
All are organized to help me **learn Java deeply and progressively**.

## âœ… Next Steps

- Improve current projects using better design patterns
- Add unit tests
- Start using packages and modules
- Build simple GUI apps in the future
